# SportsMatch Backend
## Introduction
SportsMatch encourages people to be more active by enabling them to find fellow racket sports fans to play a game with. This application serves as the backend for our final project at Makers Academy. You can find our frontend app [here](https://github.com/smasonmalik/sportsmatch_react).

The team consisted of:
- [Sid Mason-Malik](https://github.com/smasonmalik)
- [Duncan Skinner](https://github.com/Duncan9099)
- [Jess Marais](https://github.com/jessmar94)
- [Pam Mezue](https://github.com/Mezela)
- [Dom Tunstill](https://github.com/domtunstill)
- [Vijay Kurian](https://github.com/kurianvijay)

Technologies used
- Python
- Flask
- Pylint (to check code quality)
- Pytest (unit testing)
- BCrypt
- TravisCI
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL

We have 31 passing tests with an 89% test coverage. 

The project has been deployed to [Heroku](http://sportsmatch-app.herokuapp.com/).

## Additional Features
If we had more time, we would have looked to implement the following features:
- Ability to submit the score of the game.
- Ability to register with multiple sports, rather than picking just one.
- Ability for player to input their availability for other players to see - this would require creating an Availability table.
- Ability to register the result of a game as a draw.
- Add in a weather API to help players pick the best day to play.
